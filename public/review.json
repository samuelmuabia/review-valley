      "feedback": "I've been on budget laptops for years and wanted the Ryzen 5 chip, was waiting for the Acer 5 to come out with it but hasn't so I bought this and don't regret it. It's slightly chunky in thickness but has a good feel and imho a really nice keyboard. The screen is sharp and better than what I've had with Acer with zero dead pixels.",

      "feedback": "I've had this laptop for 5 months and I absolutely love it. Everything about it is decent. Sometimes I go back to my past orders in Amazon just to reflect on the time I put into researching and how happy I am with it. The only thing I notice is the battery life is only a few hours, so I probably wouldn't be productive if I was traveling, but I only use it at home so that doesn't affect me much.",

      "feedback": "This has to be one of my best investments so far. I am satisfied with how this laptop performs because it seems to work good enough with most tasks you throw at it. It doesnâ€™t freeze after having 10 tabs open with Spotify in the background. It runs GTA V and BeamNG on low settings at 45-60fps. It works smoothly with Photoshop, Blender and other workstations. Its just perfect for light gaming, browsing, editing pictures and more.",
